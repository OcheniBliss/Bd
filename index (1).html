     <p>The BMW 3-series has been the benchmark for the sport-luxury sedan segment for decades, and for good reason. The 3-series marries its smart, subtle, and handsome exterior with a rich interior that boasts a 14.9-inch touchscreen for the infotainment system and a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, giving the cabin a decidedly modern look. The 3-series also offers three excellent powertrains. The base 330i modelâ€™s turbocharged four-cylinder provides appropriate oomph and impressive fuel economy while the plug-in hybrid 330e improves efficiency and adds 23 miles of all-electric range. Sitting atop the range is the M340i, pairing a potent 382 horsepower turbocharged inline-six with a well-sorted chassis that provides deft corner-carving abilities while still gracefully handling normal daily driving needs. </p>
